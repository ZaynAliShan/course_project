                <h1 class="faq-page">What is online learning like?</h1>

                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>For those who have never encountered online learning, the biggest question is often what it is actually like. The caveat, as you know, is that online learning comes in several forms. Therefore, this is your chance to explain that to people. Point out that there are different types of online courses and programs, and that they’ll have to decide which is best for them. Then, explain the types of courses you offer and how your online programs work to give them all the information they need. This not only gives them information, but it increases their trust because you’re being transparent and giving them straightforward answers.

                <!-- faq question -->
                <h1 class="faq-page">Are you accredited or licensed by educational organizations?</h1>

                <!-- faq answer -->

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>!There is not always a need for licensing or accreditation for online courses. However, some programs do require it. Either way, people will usually ask what type of training or background you have, as well as any licensing that is  available if that is relevant. Make sure that you answer this question by telling them if you do hold any licenses or accreditation, as well as by explaining whether or not those are needed, and why. It gives them the confidence that you have the right experience and boosts your credibility because you’re offering additional information for the sake of education alone. </p>
